May 9, 2022

Today is the last day of "frogs begin singing" or 蛙始鳴 ---

And it's on this day we're launching the website [pentad.world](https://pentad.world), or "Seasons in Pentameter."

(IMAGE)

[Seasons in Pentameter](https://pentad.world) presents the 72 microseasons (kō) of Japan, each lasting five days. Also called the 72 pentads, they originated in China and were adapted to better match the seasonality of Japan, where they were rewritten in 1685 by the court astronomer Shibukawa Shunkai. As described by [nippon.com](https://www.nippon.com/en/features/h00124/), "In their present form, they offer a poetic journey through the Japanese year in which the land awakens and blooms with life and activity before returning to slumber."

This project began late last year, when designer and programmer [Marie Otsuka](http://motsuka.com) emailed me, asking if I'd be interested in making a website to showcase her font "[Pentameter](https://occupantfonts.com/fonts/pentameter/)," published by Occupant Fonts. The font Pentameter blends the precision of monospace with the expressiveness of handwriting --- while also being variable.
