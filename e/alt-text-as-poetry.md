Alt-text is a written description of an image posted online. It allows visual content to be accessible to people who are blind, low vision, or have certain cognitive disabilities.

“Alt Text as Poetry” is a project by Finnegan Shannon and Bojana Coklyat, two artist/activists, who describe: “alt text is an essential part of web accessibility. it is often disregarded or understood through the lens of compliance, as an unwelcome burden to be met with minimum effort. how can we use strategies from poetry and instead approach alt text thoughtfully and creatively?”

We created an accessible & inviting website for the project as well as a video that shares our process. In collaboration with Taichi Wi.
