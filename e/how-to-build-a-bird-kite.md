Craft tutorial and meditation on how to build a kite in interactive story format for The New York Times.

It’s part pragmatic how to and part meanderings on “the wind.” The format is an “interactive story” — you can click through the steps to get the essential information. Or let the whole tutorial play, and it’s a 46 minute film of creating a kite in real-time. Special thanks to Tracy Ma, Natalie Shutler, Austin Wade Smith, Elliott Cost, and Meg Miller.
