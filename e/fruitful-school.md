“Artists often struggle in presenting themselves and their work on the web. Fruitful school teaches artists how to create websites as a vital tool in their practice — not only for presenting existing work, but for generating entirely new work, inspiring original ways of publishing to the world wide web.” 

Fruitful.school is an independently-run workshop series founded in 2020. In collaboration with John Provencher.
