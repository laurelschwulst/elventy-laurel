Fruitful School explores how contemporary artistic practices engage with the world wide web or technology at large. We created Fruitful School to be a place where artists, designers, writers, and programmers who are curious about how their practice engages with technology today can explore new ways of working. 

Fruitful.school is an independently-run workshop series founded in 2020. In collaboration with John Provencher.
