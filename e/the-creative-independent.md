In 2016, I joined Kickstarter to launch “The Creative Independent,” a unique digital platform serving creative professionals.

As creative director, I was involved in everything — from establishing our principles, to designing the site, to building with code & copy, to growing an aligned team and process. The vision was a “Wikipedia of the creative process,” a networked resource that was radically readable and evergreen.

I built the site with evolution in mind — it’s constructed to grow every day and be gardened over time. The site has continued to grow and evolve like a living organism and today is a network of over 1500 interviews: a rich database of thought from writers, musicians, designers, visual artists, and others in six languages.
