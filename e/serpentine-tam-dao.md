Serpentine and Tam Dao are the names of two fragrances made by Comme des Garçons and Diptyque, respectively. In each video, Damon Zucconi’s voice reads aloud one of <a href="/medium/world/perfume-area">Perfume Area</a> (Laurel Schwulst & Sydney Shen)'s perfume reviews. The voice is synthetic and has no texture, but is instead composed of phonemes that are pure sine waves.

First exhibited at Kodomo (New York) for “Silver Mill,” curated by Elliott Cost, in 2016. Both videos are available for purchase at left gallery.
