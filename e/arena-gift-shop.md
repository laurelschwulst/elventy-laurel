“A gift shop is a store primarily selling souvenirs, memorabilia, and other items relating to a particular topic or theme.” 

— Wikipedia page for “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_shop" target="_blank">Gift Shop</a>”

Our theme is what makes Are.na itself: its participants, their ideas, and the worlds they create together. In other words, the gift store is a gradually growing collection of collaborations in the form of real things.
