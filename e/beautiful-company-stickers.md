Beautiful Company was a newborn company in 2014. To welcome it into the world, we designed stickers. They were created instead of something more traditional, such as a business card. Through its stickiness, the sticker tries to live in the world just a little longer than the business card.

This sticker is much smaller than typical stickers. (Each one is .75 x .25 in.) Each is transparent and domed, taking up a little three-dimensional space. It is also a lens: it is magnifies the material underneath. (It also brands that material with the company website). The stickerâ€™s size and shape mimics a raindrop, which makes it perfect for application on a laptop amidst other larger and visually aggressive stickers. The droplet sticker holds its own weight since liquid means death for electronics. On a leaf, however, it is barely noticeable.
