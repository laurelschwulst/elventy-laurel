there’s something cool about the duality of the carillon
“performing a task” (send messages, tell time) and “performing music”

there’s also the duality of the
performance of carillon … highly public
vs. the performer of carillonneur … highly private

oh! also i remember how kites were first used to perform the task of sending messages !!!
wind also changes the nature of sound transmission / it is a kind of conductor for kites

Vine shares, "Stonespeak is like a charge sent through the instrument and environment to test its capacities and expressivites."
