Icons for series of membership levels at Printed Matter, world's largest artist bookstore. They vaguely resemble cellular mitosis, but then grows into the form of a book.

Created while working at design & technology firm <a href="https://www.linkedbyair.net/">Linked by Air</a>, for their client project Printed Matter's Website.
