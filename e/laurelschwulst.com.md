This website was designed to show the interconnectedness of my work.

It has a subtle warm off-white background color "#FFFFF2."

It was built in Eleventy, a static site generator.

It can be accessed at laurelschwulst.com and also laurel.world.

It was launched on March 12, 2024.

Thanks to Reuben Son, Jungsuh Rhee, Megan Pai, Jack Rieger, Peter Pelberg, Min Guhong, and AV for guidance. And to <a href="https://www.gradientretreat.com/">Gradient Retreat</a>, a beautiful place Galiano Island near Vancouver, where this website had space to take root, Summer 2023, which I shared with Kelin Zhang, Omar Rizwan, Minkyoung Kim, Marie Otsuka, and Ansh Shukla.
