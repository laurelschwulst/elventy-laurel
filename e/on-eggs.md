It was a mysterious beginning, full of potential ‚Äî

That is, I was [invited](/e/on-eggs-talk/) to explore ‚Äúegg‚Äù as an ongoing theme in my work and life, and I was feeling excited about the prospect.

Kristoffer suggested this topic to me. He has been a keen observer of my practice for a long time now, so I had some guesses as to why he encouraged me to focus on ‚Äúegg.‚Äù

On a literal level, I hypothesized he‚Äôs been curious about my popular Are.na Channel ‚Äî ‚ÄúEggs in Art & Design.‚Äù Like its title suggests, it catalogs eggs that appear in works of art or design. I‚Äôve cultivated this collection for the past decade, with the generous contributions of many others. I also imagined Kristoffer might also sense this mysterious resonance between my life and ‚Äúegg,‚Äù although maybe I was projecting.

By choosing my favorite items from my collection, I‚Äôm able to circle back and remember what it is about the egg that moves me. Honoring the egg means considering both the visible and invisible. Eggs are beautiful as a form, and I‚Äôve realized that seeing them through art or design often allows us to appreciate them anew. Eggs are also mysterious, harboring potential energy. What is inside? What will emerge from the egg? Yet it‚Äôs important to remember eggs and their potential are nothing without the warmth of their mother, incubating them. Expanding from that, eggs are a metaphor for nurturing structures we provide others and sometimes ourselves, so we can get closer to some glowing, innate potential, excited to emerge.

Anyway, let‚Äôs begin.

I began my egg research by opening the <i>Book of Symbols</i>. I found the page for ‚ÄúEgg‚Äù and read aloud:

<blockquote class="large-quote" style="margin-bottom: 0;">The egg evokes the beginning, the simple, the source.</blockquote><a href="" class="no-underline"><cite class="after-blockquote">‚ú∂‚ú∂</cite></a>

To start from a beginning, I was born in a town called Normal, Illinois. It‚Äôs a beautiful and simple place, with many flat prairies and cornfields nearby.

Eventually, I went away from Normal to art school. As a design student at RISD, I discovered the book Super Normal: Sensations of the Ordinary. The book catalogs design objects that are classics but also often anonymous, sharing that ‚Äúsuper normal‚Äù is located beyond space and time, pointing to a future that has long since begun.

In particular, the authors (who are also designers) Naoto Fukasawa and Jasper Morrison mention the goose egg:

<blockquote class="large-quote" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
  Seeing the goose egg, we are not surprised by the form at all, but the scale of it warps our perception momentarily, allowing us to see something normal in a new way. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with the form of a chicken egg except that we are used to seeing it. Seeing the goose egg, we can enjoy the form as if seeing it for the first time.

When artists use eggs in their work, I believe they are often simply pointing to the egg as a form so that you can also see it anew again, as if appreciating it for the first time.

In these pieces, I like the simple but profound moves artists make which help us appreciate something already amazing within our world.

Similarly, when I start new projects, I spend a lot of time understanding the context to see if simply by studying it, my work can bring to life or make more apparent something special already existing.
