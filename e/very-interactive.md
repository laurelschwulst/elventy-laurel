Very Interactive is a website that serves as a living resource generated through my ongoing teaching practice. It archives materials for web visitors and students past, present, & future.

<!-- All classes & workshops exist in their own microcosm but are also "[in conversation with the world](https://www.are.na/blog/onion-and-rocks)" --- they are a generative atmosphere for knowledge production first inside, and then sometimes they share that outside, with others.

(You can learn more about my teaching practice [here](https://sites.laurel.world/laurel-schwulst-wiki/#teaching), or view my profiles at [Yale](https://www.art.yale.edu/laurel-schwulst) and [Princeton](https://arts.princeton.edu/people/profiles/schwulst/).) -->
