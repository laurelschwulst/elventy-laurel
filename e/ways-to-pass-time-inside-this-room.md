This book contains ideas for how to spend time inside a room that might also be an airplane. Originally created the summer before the pandemic, this prescient guide shares ideas to stay sane and have fun inside a confined area — alone, together, or alone & together. 

Published by the Are.na Gift Shop, Fall 2022, in an edition of 177, 6.93 x 9.85 inches (B5), 64 pages. Riso printed in Brooklyn by TXTBooks. 

The book was originally orchestrated by Laurel Schwulst in concert with Webb Allen (co-writer), Ayami Konishi (illustrations), pal (translator), and pe hu (supporter).

It began in a 2019 residency at pe hu in Osaka, Japan, which began with an exhibition of Flight Simulator. There was also an exhibition by Green People (Elliott Cost, Kazuma Sasajima, and Laurel Schwulst).
