        <p><p>About a year and a half ago, a friend on <a href="https://www.are.na">Are.na</a> suggested my channel “<a href="https://www.are.na/laurel-schwulst/wild-animals-vs-manmade-materials">Wild Animals vs. Manmade Materials</a>” would be better without the pets.</p>
<p>Had pets and other domesticated animals gradually crept into my channel without me realizing? Yes, it was true. It wasn't that dogs on skateboards and cats on roombas weren't interesting by themselves: rather, their presence had weakened my channel as a conceptual unit.</p>
<p>The distinction between wild animal and pet was important, but at the time I couldn't completely articulate why. Returning now, I recall the beginnings of my channel, the subsequent policing of pets, and how this transformation led me to more deeply consider the channel's significance.</p>

<p>I began Wild Animals vs. Manmade Materials five years ago in 2012, making it quite ancient in Are.na years. It started with a fascination towards a single piece of media —</p>
<p>At the time, I was returning to YouTube day after day to watch this mesmerizing <a href="https://www.are.na/block/78167">video</a> of leopards examining their reflections through mirrors installed in a jungle.</p>
<p>&quot;Leopards VS mirror,&quot; the original subtitle of the video, made me curious: Were the leopards &quot;against&quot; the mirror? Were the leopards preparing to fight the mirror as they circled around it, hopped on top of it, and eventually made eye contact with the creatures inside of it? But the video is long, and the mirror doesn't fight back. The leopards seem more curious than opinionated, oscillating between mirror as prey, enemy, friend, inanimate object, or possibly even self.</p>
